bootstrap3-sub-menu
===================

Reinstate the sub menu in Bootstrap 3 with CSS only
(and a *little* bit of Javascript to make it play nice on mobile, etc.)

Looking for a solution to get the sub menu back into Bootstrap 3?
Add this css and javascript and your good to go!

Please feel free to make any other tweaks necessary to make it work for you and your site.

- Desktop:

	- Top level links will not navigate away, will expand their menu on click
	- Links in levels 2+ will expand their menu on hover, but will navigate away on click

- Mobile:

	- All links with child menus will not navigate away, will expand their menu on touch

**Dependencies**

- Modernizr.js
- jQuery.js
